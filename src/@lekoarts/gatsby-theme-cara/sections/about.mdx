## About Me

>  Coding gives me the power to change lives for the better.

It started off as a fascinating tool to solve crossword-like puzzles in my college dorm room but since then has evolved into something much greater.
Throughout my career I've built apps for marketers, ad traders, and medical professionals
          to name a few. I've spent the bulk of my career in
          agile software development teams focused on building user interfaces
          with React. I take pride in writing code that is elegant and maintainable to 
          maximize ease of collaboration with teammates. While my focus is on front-end and design systems, I love challenging myself to continue learning whatever full stack skills are necessary to get the job done. Along the journey I aim for my end goal in building a product or service that myself and my team can take pride in.
