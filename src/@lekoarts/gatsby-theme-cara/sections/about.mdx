## About Me

>  What interests me about coding is the power it gives me to change lives for the better.

It started off as a fascinating tool to solve crossword-like puzzles in my college dorm room but since then has evolved into something much greater.
Throughout my career I've built apps for marketers, ad traders, and medical professionals
          to name a few. I've spent the bulk of my career in
          agile software development teams focused on building user interfaces
          with React. I take pride in writing code that is elegant and maintainable to 
          maximize ease of collaboration with teammates. While my focus is on front-end and design systems, I love to challenge myself to continue learning new skills and build something myself and my teammates can take pride in.
